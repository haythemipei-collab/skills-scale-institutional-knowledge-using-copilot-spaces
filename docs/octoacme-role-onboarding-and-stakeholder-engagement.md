### Escalation Paths

Clear escalation paths ensure issues are resolved at the appropriate level with minimal delay.

#### Standard Escalation Path
1. **Team Level**: Developer/Team Member raises issue to Technical Lead or immediate supervisor
2. **Project Level**: Technical Lead or team escalates to Project Manager
3. **Program Level**: Project Manager escalates to Project Sponsor
4. **Portfolio Level**: Project Sponsor escalates to Portfolio Owner
5. **Executive Level**: Portfolio Owner escalates to C-level or executive leadership

#### Technical Escalation Path
1. Developer → Technical Lead (technical blocker or decision)
2. Technical Lead → SME (specialized expertise needed)
3. Technical Lead → Project Manager (impacts timeline or resources)
4. Project Manager → Project Sponsor (major technical risk or investment decision)

#### Strategic Risk Escalation Path
1. Project Manager identifies strategic risk in Risk Register
2. Project Manager escalates to Project Sponsor immediately
3. Project Sponsor assesses with Portfolio Owner if cross-project impact
4. Portfolio Owner escalates to executive leadership if needed

#### Change Resistance Escalation Path
1. Change Manager identifies resistance or adoption issues
2. Change Manager works with Project Manager on mitigation
3. Project Manager engages Project Sponsor for leadership support
4. Project Sponsor leverages executive influence to address organizational barriers

#### Resource Conflict Escalation Path
1. Project Manager identifies resource constraint or conflict
2. Project Manager escalates to Project Sponsor
3. Project Sponsor negotiates with other Sponsors or escalates to Portfolio Owner
4. Portfolio Owner makes prioritization decision and reallocates resources

### Escalation Best Practices
- Escalate early when issues threaten key milestones or success criteria
- Provide clear context: what's the issue, what's the impact, what decision is needed
- Bring proposed solutions or options, not just problems
- Document escalation in Risk Register or decision log
- Close the loop by communicating resolution back down the escalation chain
